# OhioVoterMaps
Given a voter data file of an Ohio county, returns a map of registered voters and a partisanship map for each census tract in the county.

You can find the voter files on the Secretary of State's website: https://www6.ohiosos.gov/ords/f?p=VOTERFTP:HOME:::#cntyVtrFiles

The shapefiles of the counties are on the Census's website: https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html
